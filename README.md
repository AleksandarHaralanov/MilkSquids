# MilkSquids
You can now milk squids with an empty bucket in hand.
- This used to be a feature in Minecraft, however, it was removed in the b1.3_01 update.

<b>Download latest release [here](https://github.com/AleksandarHaralanov/MilkSquids/releases/latest)</b>
- Compiled on Adoptium JDK 8 and [Poseidon](https://github.com/RhysB/Project-Poseidon), fork of CB1060.

## Usage
- Squid hitboxes are kind of funky, so it might take you several tries to milk them. Recommended to take them out of the water and aim just slightly above them.
